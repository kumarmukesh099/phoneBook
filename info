  "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",  // handle hashing and passwords because we should never store plain passwords
    "config": "^3.3.2", //for making available as global variable
    "express": "^4.17.1", //  web framework handle routing

    "jsonwebtoken": "^8.5.1", //use it for authentication 
    "mongoose": "^5.10.9",  // we can add delete and other things and create schema and all

    in config , we have everything which is available for everything
    default.json - access to it in our entire project

  It is important to have models in our app which define what type of structure of data your app consists or we can say in models we defines schema
