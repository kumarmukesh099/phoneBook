  "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",  // handle hashing and passwords because we should never store plain passwords
    "config": "^3.3.2", //for making available as global variable
    "express": "^4.17.1", //  web framework handle routing
    "express-validator": "^6.6.1", //use to validate the body like email passwords
    "jsonwebtoken": "^8.5.1", //use it for authentication 
    "mongoose": "^5.10.9",  // we can add delete and other things and create schema and all

    in config , we have everything which is available for everything
    default.json - access to it in our entire project

  It is important to have models in our app which define what type of structure of data your app consists or we can say in models we defines schema

  Define a schema and use it :  create its structure using mongoose.schema({}) 
                                then mongoose.models where we define the model name and schema name and
                                then we can assign value to it using new Schema and then save it


  We are creating a folder middleware where we authenticate everytime whenever we access some private routes means a logged in user want to access his/her profile

  whenever we have a middlewarefunction we use to do next to exceute the next middlewarefunction
